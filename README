= WiiPresent - Presentations using the Wiimote

WiiPresent is a small program that enables you to use a Nintendo WiiMote
for giving presentations using Open Office, xpdf, evince or Acrobat Reader.
It was designed as an off-the-shelf tool with no need to customize it.

But WiiPresent can also control multimedia applications or firefox.
It does this by translating WiiMote events into keypresses for applications.


== Build requirements
You need the following libraries in order to build and use WiiPresent:

 - libX11 libraries and headers
 - libXtst libraries and headers
 - bluez libraries and headers
 - libcwiimote libraries and headers (build with -D_NO_BLOCKING_UPDATE)

We tried to minimize the dependencies for WiiPresent.
